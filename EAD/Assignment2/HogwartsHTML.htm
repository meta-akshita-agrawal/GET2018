					a large castle somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland. 
					The castle has extensive grounds with sloping lawns, 
					flowerbeds and vegetable patches, a loch (called the Black Lake), 
					a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, 
					and a full-size Quidditch Pitch. 
					There is also an owlery, which houses all the owls owned by the school and those owned by students.

					There are 142 staircases, which are known to move around in the massive castle which is set upon huge rocks above a magnificent lake. 
					The castle is known for its many updates and changes in layout throughout the years, such as regenerating itself after the Battle of Hogwarts. 
					It should be noted that some rooms in the school tend to "move around," and so do the steps on the grand staircase. 
					Albus Dumbledore once noted that even he did not know all of Hogwarts' secrets. 
					The castle has witnessed centuries and has a long history of ancient magic.

					The school has numerous charms and spells on and around it that make it impossible for a Muggle to see it as the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of danger. 
					Witches and wizards cannot Apparate or Disapparate in Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifts the enchantment, 
					whether only in certain areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school less vulnerable when it serves the headmaster to allow Apparition. 
					Electricity and electronic devices are not found at Hogwarts. 
					Hermione Granger indicated that due to the high levels of magic, substitutes for magic used by Muggles, such as computers, radar and electricity "go haywire" around Hogwarts. 
					Radios, however, make an exception as they are not powered by electricity, but by magic.

					Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts is considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, 
					though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, the Durmstrang Institute, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
					Children with magical abilities are enrolled at birth, and acceptance is confirmed by owl post at age eleven. 
					However, if the child in question is a Muggle-born, a professor from the school would come and inform the child's parents.
